   <h2>Why Aren't My CVs Getting Me Interviews?</h2>
   <p>Like a lock requiring a specific key, each job role has its own unique CV requirements. 
      Nowadays, employers rely on automated applicant tracking systems to assess CVs against
      the skills and keywords specified in the job description. It has never before been so easy
      for employers to reject a multitude of CVs, shutting the door in the faces of countless 
      qualified candidates, simply because of misaligned words in their documents.                                         
   </p>
   <p>Simply put, your prospective career now lies in the hands of a computer! <br>
      A good product with bad marketing won't sell.                                        
   </p>

   <h2>Camouflage Your CV/Resume With the Job Description</h2>
   <p>Rather than limit your career opportunities to a small handful of jobs that match your
      existing CVs, why not pursue the jobs you really want by blending your CVs in accordingly? <br>
      <strong>This is where <em>PaperChameleon</em> comes in!</strong>
   </p>
   <p>Use this service to tailor your CV for a high ATS score to bring you one step closer 
      towards that dream job you worked so hard to land!                                          
   </p>

   <h2>How the Process Works</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Email <strong>patrick.rolincin.bambi@gmail.com</strong> with a copy of your draft CV and a 
        link to the job description. Be sure to include <em>PaperChameleon</em> in the subject line!
    </li><br>
    <li>The draft CV copy will be ATS scanned and a quote will be provided to you, with the
        price factoring the numbers of ATS-identified skills and keywords to match, as well as the
        reformatting workload.
    </li><br>
    <li>Once you accept the quote, specific payment instructions will be provided, most likely
        involving an international bank wire, which can be done through your local bank online 
        (advanced) or in branch (beginner). Either way, your local bank may charge you a fee of
        about £25 for the international wire. This is separate from the fee charged by PaperChameleon
        for the CV optimisation service.
    </li><br>
    <li>Upon receiving proof of the wire, the CV optimisation shall commence. Although ATS
        is used to identify the buzzwords, the process of adding them to the CV in coherent
        sentencing along with reformatting is done manually. The new CV will be proof-read so it
        makes grammatical sense when assessed by human resources.
    </li><br>
    <li>You will be emailed with a copy of the new CV as a Microsoft Word document (should you wish
        to make any additional tweaks to the CV yourself), along with the ATS reports.</li>
   </ol>

  <div class = "Section">                                   
   <h2>Prices</h2>
   <p>Depending on the number of skills, experience and keywords demanded by the job description
      and the complexity of reformatting, the price per CV can vary <strong>from as little as £20 to 
      as high as £150</strong>. To minimise the costs on your end, it is recommended for you to work 
      on your draft CVs to the best of your ability before sending them over (ensure that they have
      a coherent structure, although avoid the use of flashy colours or graphics).
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "Section">                                   
   <h2>Offers</h2>
   <p>Should you order a bundle of multiple CVs to optimise, PaperChameleon caters to that too,
      and with bulk discounts on the total price available. Bundle orders are recommended to reduce 
      the proportional wiring fee charged by your local bank per CV. The discounts are as follows:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>No Discount:</strong> 1 to 4 CVs</li><br>
    <li><strong>10% Off:</strong> 5 to 9 CVs</li><br>
    <li><strong>15% Off:</strong> 10 to 19 CVs</li><br>
    <li><strong>20% Off:</strong> 20 CVs or more</li><br>
   </ul>
   <p>By default, the CVs will be worked on in ascending order of later job application deadlines
      and the completed versions along with the corresponding ATS reports will be sent to you one 
      by one as opposed to all at once, to buy you time to apply for the earlier jobs whilst the
      other CVs are worked on.

   <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <li>This service only covers the scope of CV optimisation for applicant tracking systems.</li><br>
    <li>There is no guarantee that the optimsed CV will result in an interview.</li><br>
    <li>Whilst the default standard of this service is to use the British English language,
        if certain keywords in the job description are in American English or misspelled, they will
        also need to appear that way in the CV to match the ATS.
